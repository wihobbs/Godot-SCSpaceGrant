# Godot Teaching Resources
These projects, written in C# and GDScript, are made for teaching high school students programming skills through game design. They were created with support from the NASA SC Space Grant Consortium STEM Outreach Award.

Each project contains a README file detailing the game and objectives, and within the Godot project files each project is commented.
